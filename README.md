First thing I want to say I'm not an expert at signal processing. I was going to have an interview with a proffessor who was working at signal processing in a way that he and his team use brain signals taken from some medical devices to suggest patient-specific medications/treatments, so my motivation to learn signal processing was based on this.

Signal is just a function of time.
Mainly, signals are classified based on two things: 1) the time 2) the value of the signal (which is called amplitude).
1) Depending on the time interval whether it is discrete or continuous, we can obtain discrete time and continuous time signals, respectively.
2) Depending on the values that a function/signal takes whether discrete or continuous, we can obtain digital and analog signals, respectively.


So, there are four types listed like below and they are depicted in the figure above
1. Continuous time Analog Signal
2. Discrete time Analog Signal
3. Continuous time Digital Signal
4. Discrete time Digital Signal
